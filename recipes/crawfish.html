        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>5 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>5 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 yellow onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 green bell pepper, chopped</li>
            <li>2 stalks celery, chopped</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons Cajun seasoning, divided, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)</li>
            <li>2 cups fish stock</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 pound cooked crawfish tail meat</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt butter in a Dutch oven over medium heat.  Stir in flour to make the roux, and stir continuously until roux is at least the color of peanut butter, about 10 minutes, or for a darker roux, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add onions, bell pepper, celery, and garlic; cook and stir for 5 to 7 minutes.  Stir in half the Cajun seasoning, cayenne pepper, and stock.  Season with salt and ground black pepper. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in crawfish, turn heat off, and cover.  Let stand until crawfish are heated through.  Taste and add remaining half of Cajun seasoning, if needed.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p>Chicken stock can be substituted for fish stock, and vegetable oil in place of butter.</p>
        <p>The base of this dish is thicker than gumbo.  If it is too thin, mix 2 tablespoons cornstarch with a few drops water, stir well, and add to thicken.</p>
