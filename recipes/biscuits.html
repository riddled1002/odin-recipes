        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These biscuits are decadent with a slight touch of sweetness from the honey.</p>
        <p>Serve them with butter, jelly, jam, or more honey.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup cold buttermilk</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons honey</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees (200 degrees C).  Line a baking sheet with parchment paper</li>
            <li>Stir together flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl.  Cut in butter using a pastry blender or two forks until mixture resembles course crumbs.</li>
            <li>Stir in honey and buttermilk together in a cup.  Pour into flour mixture and stir until mixture comes together.</li>
            <li>Turn mixture out onto a lightly-floured work surface.  Press dough into a rectangle shape about 1/2 inch thick.  Fold mixture into thirds, like a letter, then turn 90 degrees and press again into a 1/2 inch thick rectangle.  Fold dough into thirds one more time, and now press into a thicker rectangle, about 1 inch thick.</li>
            <li>Cut biscuits with a 2 inch round cookie cutter.  Place biscuits onto the prepared baking sheet.  Press together any remaining dough scraps to form final biscuits.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until biscuits begin to turn golden, 13 to 15 minutes.  Cool on a rack for a few minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p>For an even sweeter biscuit, you can add up to 1/4 cup honey to the dough.  You can also use up to 1 teaspoon kosher salt for a slightly saltier biscuit.  This recipe makes about 10 biscuits depending on the size of cutter you use.</p>
